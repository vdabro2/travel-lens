## Overview
### Description
Uses google maps API to get your current location or an entered location and show peoples posts around there. Peoples posts will have them reviewing places they go to. 

This idea is geared towards unexpirienced travelers who want to find new places to go to while staying safe when traveling. 

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Travel, Social, Entertainment
- **Mobile:** This app is primarily used for mobile devices although a web version could be made over time.
- **Story:** This app is versatile because people can post reviews of all the places they go to while traveling. It doesnt need to be resturants or tourist attractions, it can also be hidden gems in a new city! This can hopefully help others out who are visiting the area to know where are some local spots and many other things. By making this locations based, we can use the idea of locals helping out traveling tourists to experience their area. 
- **Market:** Everyone who likes to travel or even just explore new places in their area. 
- **Habit:** You could be an everyday user just trying to find new things and places. You could also just use the app sporadically when looking for a day trip or a farther place to travel to. 
- **Scope:** This app can be extended forward as a place to also find friends while traveling and create a social media feel. We can go further by matching a person to a place to visit by creating an explore page.
